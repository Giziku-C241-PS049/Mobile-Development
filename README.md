# Giziku-C241-PS049

# Overview
Giziku is an android Application that was created because there was a concerning fact about some malnutrition problem for some of the people in Indonesia. The giziku team would like to educate the people of Indonesia about how impactful nutrition is in our daily life. Also we would like to help people who are curious about what nutrition their food has so that they can know if it is a healthy food or not. Giziku itself is an android based application that has three main features. The first one is a nutrition classification based on the user image, a recommendation system  for those who want to eat healthy food Also we would like to inform users on what food that are healthy based on desire input. The second one is a feature that could classify common Indonesian foods nutrition.  Lastly,  we would like to build an app that is hopefully easy to use and easy to read UI.
